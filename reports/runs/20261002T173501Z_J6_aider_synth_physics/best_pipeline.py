"""Candidate data pipeline around a FROZEN tabular foundation model.

The harness calls, in order:
  1. preprocess(X_train, y_train, X_test)        -> X_train, y_train, X_test   (cleaning, target transform)
  2. engineer(X_train, y_train, X_test)          -> X_train, X_test            (feature engineering, <= 500 cols)
  3. sample(X_train, y_train, X_test, max_rows)  -> list of index arrays       (context views; each view is fit separately
                                                                                 and predictions are averaged)
  4. frozen model fit/predict per view (never edit this part; MODEL_KWARGS tunes the constructor)
  5. postprocess(pred, y_train_orig, X_test)     -> pred                       (invert target transforms, calibrate)

`pred` is a pandas DataFrame of class probabilities (columns = class labels) for classification, or a
pandas Series for regression. `y_train_orig` is the untransformed training target. All inputs are pandas
objects; X_train / X_test share columns. Do not read any file other than the ones in this directory.
